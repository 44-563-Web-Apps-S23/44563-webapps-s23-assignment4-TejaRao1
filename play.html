            WHITE DRESSES

            TIME: _The evening before Christmas, 1900_.
 
       AUNT CANDACE. Honey, I's been a-waitin' foh you de las' two hours. My
       haid's been bad off. Chile, whah you been? Miss Mawgin must a had a
       pow'ful washin' up at de big house.
       
            [MARY _opens her hand and shows her a five-dollar bill_.
       
       AUNT CANDACE. De Lawd help my life, chile!
       
       MARY. An' look here what Mr. Henry sent you, too. [_She undoes the
       bundle, revealing several cooked sweet potatoes, sausages, spareribs,
       and some boiled ham._] He said as 'twas Christmas time he sent you this
       with the collards there.
       
            [_She points toward the collards at the window._ AUNT CANDACE _pays
            little attention to the food as_ MARY _places it in her lap, but
            continues to look straight into_ MARY'S _face. The girl starts to
            give her the money, but she pushes her away._
       
       AUNT CANDACE. [_Excitedly._] Whah'd you git dat, honey? Whah'd you git
       it? Mr. Henry ain't never been dat kind befo'. Dey ain't no past
       Christmas times he was so free wid 'is money. He ain't de kind o' man
       foh dat. An' he a-havin' 'is washin' done on Christmas Eve. [_Her look
       is direct and troubled._] Chile, Mr. Hugh didn't give you dat money, did
       he?
       
       MARY. [_Still looking in the fire._] Aunty, I ain't said Mr. Henry sent
       you this money. Yes'm, Mr. Hugh sent it to you. I done some washin' for
       him. I washed his socks and some shirts--pure silk they was. [_She
       smiles at the remembrance._] An' he give me the money an' tole me to
       give it to you--said he wished he could give you somethin' more.
       
            [_She hands the money to_ AUNT CANDACE, _who takes it quickly_.
       
       AUNT CANDACE. Help my soul an' body! De boy said dat! Bless 'is soul! He
       ain't fo'got 'is ol' aunty, even if he ain't been to see 'er since he
       come back from school way out yander. De Lawd bless 'im! Allus was a
       good boy, an' he ain't changed since he growed up nuther. When I useter
       nuss 'im he'd never whimper, no suh. Bring me de tin box, honey. An'
       don't notice what I's been sayin'. I spects I's too perticler 'bout you.
       I dunno.
       
            [MARY _goes to the bureau and gets a tin box. She puts the money
            in it, returns it, and lights the lamp._ AUNT CANDACE _takes off
            her bonnet and hangs it behind her on the rocking-chair. Then she
            begins to eat greedily, now and then licking the grease off her
            fingers. Suddenly she utters a low scream, putting her hands to her
            head and rocking to and fro. She grasps her stick and begins
            beating about her as if striking at something, crying out in a loud
            voice._
       
       AUNT CANDACE. Ah-hah, I'll git you! I'll git you!
       
            [MARY _goes to her and pats her on the cheek_.
       
       MARY. It's your poor head, ain't it, aunty? You rest easy, I'll take
       care of you. [_She continues to rub her cheek and forehead until the
       spell passes._] Set still till I git in a turn of light-wood. It's goin'
       to be a terrible cold night an' looks like snow.
       
            [_After a moment_ AUNT CANDACE _quiets down and begins eating
            again_. MARY _goes out and brings in an armful of wood which she
            throws into the box. She takes a bottle and spoon from the mantel,
            and starts to pour out some medicine._
