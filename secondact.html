        <p> MARY. [_Lost in abstraction, apparently has not been listening._] Aunty,
            you ought to see him now. He's better to me than he ever was. He's as
            kind as he can be. An' he wears the finest clothes! [_She stares in the
            fire._</p>
            
            AUNT CANDACE. Dat he do. Dey ain't no 'sputin' of it. I allus said he's
            de best-lookin' nigger in de country. An' dey ain't nobody kinder'n Jim.
            No, suh.
            
            MARY. An' to-day he said 'twas a pity I had to work an' wash like a
            slave for a livin'. He don' treat me like I was a nigger. He acts like
            I'm white folks. Aunty, you reckon ...
            
            AUNT CANDACE. [_Gazing at her with a troubled look of astonishment._] I
            knows it, honey, I knows it. Course dey ain't no better nigger'n Jim an'
            I wants you to marry Jim. He's awaitin' an' ...
            
            MARY. [_Vehemently._] I ain't talkin' 'bout Jim. What's Jim? He ain't
            nothin'.
            
            AUNT CANDACE. [_Guessing at the truth, half rises from her seat._] What
            you mean? Huh! What you talkin' 'bout?
            
            MARY. [_Wearily sitting down._] Nothin', aunty, jes' talkin'.
            
            AUNT CANDACE. Jes' talkin'? Chile ... chile ...
            
            MARY. Aunty, did you ever wish you was white?
